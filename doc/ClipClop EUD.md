####Have you ever had to switch between apps an absurd amount of times just to get the information that you needed?####
Often times it would be nice to have access to more than one item in the clipboard. ClipClop is here to solve those problems for you in an intuitive way. ClipClop is a clipboard buffer that you can use to store different amounts of clipped information in order to access it easier in the future.

###How does ClipClop work?###
ClipClop runs in the background so that it will not interfere with what you are doing on your phone. When ClipClop is started on your phone it will create a persistent notification that will show you what items you currently have in your clipboard buffer. By clicking on one of the items in your buffer, it will make that item the current item in your clipboard. You can also change the number of items that you keep in your buffer.
